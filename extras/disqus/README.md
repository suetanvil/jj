# Disqus Integration

This directory contains hook templates to enable Disqus comments.

The code is based on the universal embed code provided by Disqus
[here](http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472097-universal-embed-code).
Other licensing terms may apply.

It has only been tested using the jj-andreas08 template so far.

To use:

1. Copy the *.tpl files into your blog's root directory.
2. Replace all instances of the string `EXAMPLE` (case sensitive)
   with your Disqus shortname.
3. Add the *.tpl files to git.
4. Re-render and upload your site.
5. (Optional) Try to debug what went wrong.
